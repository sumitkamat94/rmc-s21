# Instructions:
In your local environment for the folder `dojosims`, add the packages `Dojo` and `DojoEnvironments`
Restart julia, and run the file `atlas_drop.jl`: 
```
julia>include("atlas_drop.jl")
```
The file will activate the local environment, instantiate the packages, precompile if it has to, and then proceed to simulate the Atlas robot and provide a visualization in your browser (output contains a url and instructions).
